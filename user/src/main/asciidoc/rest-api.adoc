== User REST Api

NOTE: The following general principles apply to every REST operations :

- Items relationships are always lazyloaded and must be explicitly requested to retrieve them. (they are not eagerly fetched)
- Role based access requires authentication. Authentication is performed using JaaS for operations which require specific roles such as _admin_ or _user_, in a stateless way for each request. See https://github.com/remibantos/jeeshop#security-domain-configuration[this link] for details about JaaS configuration in Jeeshop backend.
